# Error-handling in C++

Exception handling in C++ is a fundamental mechanism for managing runtime errors gracefully, preventing a program from crashing when an unexpected event occurs. It provides a structured approach to separate the error-handling code from the normal program logic, which makes the code cleaner and more robust.

## Key Concepts
### Exception:
An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Common examples include attempting to divide by zero, accessing an out-of-bounds array element, or trying to open a non-existent file.

### try block:
A block of code where you place statements that might throw an exception. The program monitors this block for any errors. If an exception occurs, the normal execution of the try block is stopped, and control is transferred to the appropriate catch block.

### throw statement: 
Used to signal that an exception has occurred. You can throw an object of any type, including built-in types (like int or string) or custom exception classes. The value you throw is then passed to the catch block for handling.

### catch block: 
A block of code designed to handle a specific type of exception. When an exception is thrown, the program searches for a catch block that can handle the type of exception thrown. If a match is found, the code inside the catch block is executed.


## Practical Applications
1. Division by Zero
A classic example of an exception is division by zero. By using a try block, you can safely perform a division operation. If the denominator is zero, you can throw an integer or string that signals the error. A catch block can then intercept this error and display a user-friendly message like "Division by zero is not allowed."


3. Age Validation
Exception handling can also be used for input validation. For example, in an age validation system, you can throw different exceptions for different error conditions, such as a negative age or an age below a certain threshold. The program's catch blocks can then handle these distinct exceptions with specific error messages. This prevents invalid data from being processed and improves the reliability of your program.



## Conclusion
Using try, throw, and catch provides a robust framework for managing unexpected events in C++. This approach separates error-handling logic from the main code, making programs more reliable and easier to read. Exception handling is an essential skill for building user-friendly and resilient applications. It ensures that your program can handle errors gracefully, providing a better user experience and preventing abrupt termination.
